For this problem, same as problem 2, basic breadth-first search, BFS was used. This code check same level of directory first, after that check next deeper level directory and so one.
Time complexity is O(N) because all file and folder are checked once.
Memory complexity is O(N) in worst case, like all files and directories are same level.
